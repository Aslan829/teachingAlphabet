# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This app is designed to be an educational app to help children learn how to pronounce the letters of the alphabet. The app will eventually have all the letters of the alphabet, but it is currently in a prototype mode with only A-I. 
This app will have the user press a button for a letter and the app will output the letter in a text output and output a voice recording of the letter. 
In this current state, the code only displays the buttons and the output box with a "0" at the bottom.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
